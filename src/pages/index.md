This October, Wagtail Space will take place in Minsk for the first time. The event will be a two day sprint dedicated to the open source Wagtail content management system. Participants will include Python and JavaScript developers, UX and UI designers, translators and editors.

Wagtail Space will be held with the support of core developers of the project, from countries including the United Kingdom, Netherlands, France and Belarus.

## What is Wagtail?

[Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/) is an open source content management system (CMS) based on Django Framework. The project was made public in 2014 by [Torchbox](https://torchbox.com/) and since then is rapidly gaining popularity all over the world. Users include [Google](https://blog.google/), [NASA](https://open.nasa.gov/) and [The Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/), as well as many government projects and non-commercial organisations.
